Check out [Gauzilla Pro](https://www.gauzilla.xyz/) for an AI-powered & feature-rich editor version. * Uses WebGL and CPU splat sorting (based on [splat](https://github.com/antimatter15/splat)) for high compatibility among web browsers * Circumvents [WASM's limitations in multithreading](https://rustwasm.github.io/2018/10/24/multithreading-rust-and-wasm.html) via the use of the lock-free [bus](https://github.com/jonhoo/bus) mechanism * Uses [rfd](https://github.com/PolyMeilex/rfd) to securely load a .ply or .splat file stored locally on the host machine * Loads a .splat file asynchronously from a URL (CDN) without having to use async code in Rust * Loads a [.spz](https://scaniverse.com/news/spz-gaussian-splat-open-source-file-format) file using a WASM module compiled from the official C++ implementation",
